Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top, for sure, I'ma make it hot, baby
